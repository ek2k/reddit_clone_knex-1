##Reddit Clone

For this assignment you will need to combine your knowledge of express, SQL and Knex to build a Reddit clone where users can create posts and comment on those posts. 

###Requirements

Your application must at least have full CRUD on the following three resources: 

- Users
- Posts
- Comments

Users should be able to write many posts and each post can have multiple comments. How you would like to display this information is up to you

###Data Modeling

Think about how your data is going to be structured. Diagram your schema and draw the relationships between each one of your tables. What data is going to be inside of these tables? What kind of relationships will exist between these tables?

###Styling

Styling is not a huge component of this project, but feel free to make your site look nice. Add Bootstrap, SemanticUI, or roll your own styling from scratch. 

###Bonuses

1. Include an additional resource - tags. This should be a many-to-many association with posts. Posts should have multiple tags, and many different tags can be associated with many posts.
1. A user should be able to not only comment on posts, but comment on other users, tags and even comments!

###Super Bonus

Use the actual reddit API for additional functionality!
